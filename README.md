COLMAP
======

VS 实在是让人舍不得……以至于 win 上如此难以配置，我还是要费劲千辛万苦把它配置到 VS 里。

步骤：

-   [QT5](http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/qtproject/official_releases/qt/5.8/5.8.0/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015_64-5.8.0.exe) *我的备份：<http://url.cn/44NeIZA> (273 MB)*
-   [Boost](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.63.0/)，需要设置环境变量：`BOOST_DIR`，`BOOST_ROOT` *我的备份：<http://url.cn/44Ne6Ex> (116 MB)*
-   [OpenCV3](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/3.2.0) (optional) *我的备份：<http://url.cn/44Nx1Sl> (53 MB)*

TODO:

-   equirectangular -> box images
-   image match

About
-----

COLMAP is a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) pipeline with a graphical and command-line interface. It offers a wide
range of features for reconstruction of ordered and unordered image collections.

builds on top of existing works and when using specific algorithms within
COLMAP, please also cite the original authors, as specified in the source code.


Download
--------

Executables and other resources can be downloaded from
http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jschoenb/colmap/.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the pre-built binaries from
   http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jschoenb/colmap/ or build the library manually as
   described in the documentation.
2. Download one of the provided datasets at
   http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jschoenb/colmap/datasets/ or use your own images.
3. Watch the short introductory video at
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-EC0DzeVEU or read the tutorial
   in the documentation at https://colmap.github.io/ for more details.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at https://colmap.github.io/.


Support
-------

Please, use the COLMAP Google Group at
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/colmap (colmap@googlegroups.com) for
questions and the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/colmap/colmap for
bug reports, feature requests/additions, etc.


Acknowledgments
---------------

The library was written by Johannes L. Schönberger
(http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jschoenb/). Funding was provided by his PhD advisor
Jan-Michael Frahm (http://frahm.web.unc.edu/) through the grants NSF No.
IIS-1349074, No. CNS-1405847, and the MITRE Corp.


Contribution
------------

Contributions (bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, etc.) are very welcome and
should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.

Please, adhere to the Google coding style guide:

    https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

by using the provided ".clang-format" file.

Document functions, methods, classes, etc. with inline documentation strings
describing the API, using the following format:

    // Short description.
    //
    // Longer description with a few sentences and multiple lines.
    //
    // @param parameter1            Description for parameter 1.
    // @param parameter2            Description for parameter 2.
    //
    // @return                      Description of optional return value.

Add unit tests for all newly added code and make sure that algorithmic
"improvements" generalize and actually improve the results of the pipeline on a
variety of datasets.
